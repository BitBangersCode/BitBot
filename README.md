# BitBot
A Discord Bot

Requires a config.json:

```
{
  "token" : "TOKEN",
  "prefix" : "!"
  "deathRole" : "role"
}
```
Create the deathRole from the config file on your server. This role will need to be placed above any role that you want to be affected by death.
To make this more interesting you can limit the deathRole to a certain channel such as a hell channel.

Requires a stats.json:

```
{

}
```
